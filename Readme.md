# Durak Online (offline) game

Card game for players that want to play it in local network (a lot of stuff to realise left)

## Already realised features:
- Registering in game
- Cards and deck
- Distribution of cards
- Getting hand


## Dependencies
- Go (of course)
- Bash and jq (to run tests)

# TODO
- split into different layers (eg: handlers, business, repository)
- add game logic (players queue, throwing cards, beating cards, reward for winning)
- web application or mobile application (GUI, can be in another repository)
